; DCPU-16 Tetris
; by andy@a1k0n.net

; Controls:
; Q   E - rotate left/right
;   W   - immediate drop (you can still slide afterwards)
; A   D - move left/right
;   S   - fast fall

; Arrow keys also work, but javascript emulators currently have issues with
; arrow key handling.  The keyboard spec is terrible, BTW.

; TODO list:
;  - proper score for double/triple/tetris/combos/etc
;  - proper game over detection
;  - faster screen redraws
;  - startup screen w/ logo
;  - proper wall kicks
;  - ghost piece
;  - hold function
